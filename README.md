# Tictactoe

Welcome to the TicTacToe Game Processor, an Elixir Phoenix API that manages a TicTacToe game, allowing any type of client and providing a common interface for them to play a game.

## Main Technology stack

*  [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
*  [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

## Deployment

Deployment has done using one of the most popular PaaS [Heroku using the container stack](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html).

> Note :  It might take up to 20 sec to get the API response first time, because Heroku unloads applications from the memory after some inactivity time and In-memory state such as those in Agents, GenServers, and ETS will be lost every 24 hours means a started game if not completed within 24 hours will be vanished.
See [Dyno Sleeping](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping).

### App URL
https://tictac9.herokuapp.com

## Getting up and running:

#### To start application as a local Phoenix server:

  * Install Elixir from the [Elixir downloads page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * The game processor should be accessible now in `localhost:4000`.
  * Currently test cases are broken due to ecto dependecies ðŸ˜‘ , `mix test` and  `mix acceptance` commands will not work

#### To start application using Docker:

* Make sure Docker Deamon is up and running by verify with one of the commands `docker run hello-world` or `docker info`
* Navigate to the app root directory
* build the image by running `docker build -t tictac .`  don't forget to add a dot 
* `docker run -p 4000:4000 tictac`
* The game processor should be accessible now in `localhost:4000`.

## How to use the Game Processor

### Start a game

Game Processor provides an endpoint to start a game. You need to do a POST request to the following endpoint:
```
http://localhost:4000/api/v1/game/create
```
An example response will be in the form of unique gameId in UUID form:
```
{
  "game_id": "fdaee005-b595-4fc9-b30b-8a223da0ea57"
}
```

### Performing a move.

Game Processor provides a way to get a player to move.

You need to do a POST operation to the following endpoint:

```
http://localhost:4000/api/v1/game/move
```
You need to provide the specific parameters to move API as below in the request body. 

```
{
    
    "game_params" :{
        "game_id" : "080440c6-13b3-4e54-92d5-346dbc5b6511",
        "col" : 2,
        "row" : 3,
        "player" : "o"
    }
}
```
* `game_id`: Unique game Id generated by create game API 
* `col`: Board column number for a move, it should be within 1..3 range only 
* `row`: Board row number for a move, it should be within 1..3 range only 
* `player`: valid players are X and O, either uppercase or lower

#### Following checks will be validated by the game processor for the right move.
