# Tictactoe

Welcome to the TicTacToe Game Processor, an Elixir Phoenix API that manages a TicTacToe game, allowing any type of client and providing a common interface for them to play a game.

## Main Technology stack

*  [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
*  [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

## Deployment

Deployment has done using one of the most popular PaaS [Heroku using the container stack](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html).

> Note :  It might take up to 20 sec to get the API response first time, because Heroku unloads applications from the memory after some inactivity time and In-memory state such as those in Agents, GenServers, and ETS will be lost every 24 hours means a started game if not completed within 24 hours will be vanished.
See [Dyno Sleeping](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping).

### App URL
https://tictac9.herokuapp.com

## Getting up and running:

#### To start application as a local Phoenix server:

  * Install Elixir from the [Elixir downloads page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * The game processor should be accessible now in `localhost:4000`.
  * Currently test cases are broken due to ecto dependecies ðŸ˜‘ , `mix test` and  `mix acceptance` commands will not work

#### To start application using Docker:

* Make sure Docker Deamon is up and running by verify with one of the commands `docker run hello-world` or `docker info`
* Navigate to the app root directory
* build the image by running `docker build -t tictac .`  don't forget to add a dot 
* `docker run -p 4000:4000 tictac`
* The game processor should be accessible now in `localhost:4000`.

## How to use the Game Processor

### Start a game

Game Processor provides an endpoint to start a game. You need to do a POST request to the following endpoint:
```
http://localhost:4000/api/v1/game/create
```
An example response will be in the form of unique gameId in UUID form:
```
{
  "game_id": "fdaee005-b595-4fc9-b30b-8a223da0ea57"
}
```

### Performing a move.

Game Processor provides a way to get a player to move.

You need to do a POST operation to the following endpoint:

```
http://localhost:4000/api/v1/game/move
```
You need to provide the specific parameters to move API as below in the request body. 

```
{
    
    "game_params" :{
        "game_id" : "080440c6-13b3-4e54-92d5-346dbc5b6511",
        "col" : 2,
        "row" : 3,
        "player" : "o"
    }
}
```
* `game_id`: Unique game Id generated by create game API 
* `col`: Board column number for a move, it should be within 1..3 range only 
* `row`: Board row number for a move, it should be within 1..3 range only 
* `player`: valid players are X and O, either uppercase or lower

#### Following checks will be validated by the game processor for the right move.

`lib/tictactoe_web/controllers/fallback_controller.ex` contains all the errors thrown by the game processor in case of an invalid move

* `game-Id`: A valid state game-id required for a move
* `player`: player passed must be X or O
* `cell coordinates`: row and column range should be 1..3 
* `cell occupied`: row and column should be empty for a proper move
* `player-turn`: The same player is not allowed in 2 consecutive moves 

A valid move response will contain the response.
```
{
  "board": {
    "{\"col\":1,\"row\":1}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":1,\"row\":2}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":1,\"row\":3}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":2,\"row\":1}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":2,\"row\":2}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":2,\"row\":3}": "o",
    "{\"col\":3,\"row\":1}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":3,\"row\":2}": "empty",
    "{\"col\":3,\"row\":3}": "empty"
  },
  "game_id": "1266eec6-8f95-4c3b-9473-46e3a41e955e",
  "player": "x",
  "winner": false
}
```
* The current board after the move.
* The player that performed the move as a value of cell coordinate value.
* The current game Id.
* Next player turn.

> If a move encounter a winning or tie, an appropriate message would be displayed to encourage the players ðŸŽ‰

### Flow & Design

To ensure an error occurred in a game would be handled appropriately and not prevent the rest of the running games, we wanted something fault-tolerant. 

 We wanted a tool that makes it easy to track the state of a game. By leveraging [Dynamic Supervisors](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.12/DynamicSupervisor.html) and [GenServers](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html), we can concurrently maintain lots, and lots of games, having an in-memory game state, gracefully handle any errors that might occur for a given game deployment and track each game process.

### App glossary

`GameSupervisor` :  A DynamicSupervisor which starts with no children. Children GameProcessors are started on demand. GameSupervisor allows players to start games, and it also automatically restarts them when a game process crashes. 

`GameProcessor` : Its a GenServer to keep each gameâ€™s state, With our GenServer callbacks in place, we can spawn a process that keeps a gameâ€™s state.

`GameRegistry` : 
We canâ€™t name a process with a string; we need to use a [Registry](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Registry.html) to link string names to game PID's. Elixirâ€™s GenServer implementation has a built-in way of referring to processes in a registry through itâ€™s :via-tuples

<!-- Further improvements:

This is our MVP version of the GameEngine. We wanted to follow Start small and Fail fast principles so we can get your feedback earlier and make changes that makes sense for you as the user of the app.

In spite of that we have considered:

    Improve managing of error in the application and edge cases. So far we have pretty much cover the happy path and some simple edge cases.
    Having concurrent games. It'd be great if this Engine could manage several games happening at the same time. Imagine even a computer player able to play against several human players. -->
