# Tictactoe

This is an Elixir Phoenix backend API application that provides rest endpoints to play a TicTacToe board game.
API's designed in such a way that any frontend web or mobile applications can consume them.

## Deployment

Deployment has done using one of the most popular PaaS [Heroku using the container stack](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html).

> Note :  It might take up to 20 sec to get the API response first time, because Heroku unloads applications from the memory after some inactivity time. See [Dyno Sleeping](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping).

### App URL
https://tictac9.herokuapp.com






In-memory state such as those in Agents, GenServers, and ETS will be lost every 24 hours.



To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
